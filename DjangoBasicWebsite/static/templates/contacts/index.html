  <h1>Contacts App</h1> 
  
  <p>Welcome to our comunity!</p>

  <p>We are the Coloured Sweat, a rock band from Italy. We started our activity in 2010 and since then we experienced the problem of the "making money with music".
  We believe that some money is necessary to maintain any artistic activity not just the commercial ones. Thatâ€™s why we developed this app and now we are trying 
  to build a community around it.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>We believe that the easy-est way of getting some money from our musician-sheep, especially at the emerging level, is to play a lot of gigs and start to build a
  net of relationships with others in the field. This is easy to say, but like the most of the things of this kind, very hard to do in practice.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>In the past we spent a lot of time (probably still not enough) searching on the web for new contacts, new venues where to play, new radios where to present our 
  work, and so on. We noticed that just a little amount of peoples that we contacted were interested in what we were doing, as it happens for everybody that is not 
  famous. So we started to think that is necessary to have a really huge amount of contacts if we want to find the people that want an can help us. Our singer started 
  to think about a database of contacts and to develop it. After a while started to came out the idea:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p> Why not to share our contacts with others? If I have 20 contacts and another guy has other 20, if we put it together we have both 40! It means that booth of us
  has doubled their possibility to find the right people to develop their artistic career!</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>So there we are: We put on our web-site this app were you can share your contacts, access a huge database of them and with few clicks simply email them. We believe
  that this can help a lot. But that's not all: you can rate the contacts from the database! For example if a venue is not honest and don't pay what they promise you can
  leave a negative feedback! And you can leave a positive one in the case of a good contact. This is also very useful we think.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>And remember, now you are a part of a community and a community works just if everybody helps. That's your responsibility!</p>
